  see this @windo.md  and tell me what do you think?

  The analysis in windo.md is correct regarding the problem (missing VC++ Runtime and WebView2), but the proposed config only fixes WebView2. Recommended a hybrid approach: static linking for VC++ Runtime (via .cargo/config.toml) and embedBootstrapper for WebView2 (via tauri.conf.json) to ensure the app works out-of-the-box on Windows.
