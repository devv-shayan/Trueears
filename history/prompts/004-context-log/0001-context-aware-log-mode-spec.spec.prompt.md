## Prompt

User initiated a brainstorming session about competitor analysis (Superwhisper) and potential features for Trueears. After discussing several options including:
- Reprocess from History
- Clipboard Context Injection
- Ephemeral Scratchpad
- OS Notification "Ghost Draft"

User converged on "Context-Aware Log Mode" - a feature that allows voice-triggered logging to app-specific files without interrupting workflow.

Key decisions from brainstorming:
- Trigger Method: Voice command (customizable by user in settings)
- Destination: Based on active window, file name based on app
- Default Behavior: Ask user to configure if no mapping exists
- Format: Markdown bullet with timestamp (- [YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM] text)
- Feedback: Sound + Visual confirmation

Command: /sp.specify Context-Aware Log Mode

## Response snapshot

Created comprehensive feature specification for Context-Aware Log Mode including:
- 4 prioritized user stories (P1: Basic Voice Logging, P2: First-Time Config, P3: Trigger Customization, P3: Mapping Management)
- 13 functional requirements covering trigger detection, file operations, settings management, and fallback behavior
- 5 edge cases with defined behaviors
- 5 measurable success criteria
- Clear assumptions and out-of-scope boundaries
- Quality checklist with all items passing

## Outcome

- Impact: Feature specification complete and validated
- Tests: N/A (spec phase)
- Files: specs/004-context-log/spec.md, specs/004-context-log/checklists/requirements.md
- Next prompts: /sp.clarify or /sp.plan
- Reflection: Brainstorming led to a well-scoped feature that aligns with Trueears's minimalist philosophy while adding significant value for developers

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: None - user clarifications were gathered effectively
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): Spec quality checklist - PASS (all items)
- Prompt variant (if applicable): N/A
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): Proceed to /sp.plan for implementation design
