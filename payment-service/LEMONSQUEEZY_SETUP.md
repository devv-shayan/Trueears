LEMONSQUEEZY_STORE_ID=your_store_id  # From Step 1

# LEMONSQUEEZY_VARIANT_ID_PRO_MONTHLY - DELETE THIS
# LEMONSQUEEZY_VARIANT_ID_PRO_ANNUAL - DELETE THIS

# Environment
IS_PRODUCTION=false
LEMONSQUEEZY_TEST_MODE=true  # Keep true for development
```

---

## 🔄 Update Payment Service Code for One-Time Payments

### Update `src/config.rs`

Replace the subscription variant config with:

```rust
pub struct Config {
    // ... existing fields ...
    
    // One-time payment variants (replace subscription variants)
    pub variant_id_basic: String,
    pub variant_id_pro: String,
    
    // Remove these:
    // pub variant_id_basic_monthly: String,
    // pub variant_id_basic_annual: String,
    // pub variant_id_pro_monthly: String,
    // pub variant_id_pro_annual: String,
}

impl Config {
    pub fn from_env() -> Result<Self, ConfigError> {
        // ... existing code ...
        
        let variant_id_basic = env::var("LEMONSQUEEZY_VARIANT_ID_BASIC")
            .map_err(|_| ConfigError::MissingEnvVar("LEMONSQUEEZY_VARIANT_ID_BASIC".to_string()))?;
        
        let variant_id_pro = env::var("LEMONSQUEEZY_VARIANT_ID_PRO")
            .map_err(|_| ConfigError::MissingEnvVar("LEMONSQUEEZY_VARIANT_ID_PRO".to_string()))?;
        
        Ok(Config {
            // ... existing fields ...
            variant_id_basic,
            variant_id_pro,
        })
    }
}
```

### Update Database Schema

**Important**: One-time payments use **Orders** instead of **Subscriptions** as the primary entity.

#### Migration: Update orders table to include license key

```sql
-- Add to migrations/003_create_orders.sql or create new migration
ALTER TABLE orders ADD COLUMN license_key VARCHAR(255);
ALTER TABLE orders ADD COLUMN license_key_status VARCHAR(50) DEFAULT 'active';
ALTER TABLE orders ADD COLUMN activations_used INTEGER DEFAULT 0;
ALTER TABLE orders ADD COLUMN activations_limit INTEGER DEFAULT 3;

CREATE INDEX idx_orders_license_key ON orders(license_key);
```

#### Update `src/models/order.rs`

```rust
#[derive(Debug, Clone, Serialize, Deserialize, FromRow)]
pub struct Order {
    pub id: Uuid,
    pub customer_id: Uuid,
    pub ls_order_id: i64,
    pub subscription_id: Option<Uuid>,  // Will be NULL for one-time payments
    pub status: OrderStatus,
    pub total: i64,
    pub currency: String,
    pub refunded_amount: i64,
    pub test_mode: bool,
    
    // License key fields (for one-time payment)
    pub license_key: Option<String>,
    pub license_key_status: Option<String>,  // active, inactive, expired
    pub activations_used: i32,
    pub activations_limit: i32,
    
    pub created_at: DateTime<Utc>,
    pub updated_at: DateTime<Utc>,
}
```

- ✅ Test full checkout → license key delivery flow
- ✅ Verify license key activation in desktop app
- ✅ Test license key with activation limit (try activating on 4th device)
- ✅ Test order refund flow

---

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### Webhook Not Received

**Check**:
1. Service is running: `curl http://localhost:3002/health`
2. ngrok tunnel is active (if local dev)
3. Webhook URL in LemonSqueezy is correct with `/webhooks/lemonsqueezy` path
4. Firewall/security groups allow incoming traffic
5. Check LemonSqueezy webhook logs for delivery attempts
6. Webhook events include `order_created` (not just subscriptions)

### License Key Not Received

**Check**:
1. License keys are enabled for the product
2. "Send license key email" is checked in product settings
3. Check customer's spam/junk folder
4. Verify webhook `license_key_created` is selected
5. Check LemonSqueezy email logs

### Signature Verification Fails

**Check**:
1. `LEMONSQUEEZY_WEBHOOK_SECRET` matches dashboard secret
2. No extra spaces or newlines in `.env` value
3. Service is reading the correct `.env` file
4. Webhook payload isn't being modified by proxy/CDN

### Checkout URL Invalid

**Check**:
1. Variant IDs are correct (only 2 now: basic and pro)
2. API key has permissions (not read-only)
3. Test mode setting matches product mode
4. Store ID is correct
5. Using correct endpoint (one-time payment, not subscription)

| **Updates** | Included while subscribed | Basic: 1 year, Pro: lifetime |

## 💡 Implementation Notes for One-Time Payment

### Phase 2-9 Adjustments:

1. **Phase 2 (Webhook Verification)**: Handle `order_created` instead of `subscription_created`
2. **Phase 3 (Event Logging)**: Log order events, not subscription events
3. **Phase 4**: Replace "Subscription Created Handler" with "Order Created Handler"
4. **Phase 5 (Checkout)**: Create checkout for one-time payment variants
5. **Phase 6 (Status Query)**: Query order status + license key validation
6. **Phase 7-8**: Remove subscription management (cancel, pause, resume, upgrade/downgrade)
7. **Add New Phase**: License key activation/deactivation API

### New API Endpoints Needed:

- `POST /api/checkout` - Create checkout (same, but for one-time variants)
- `GET /api/orders/me` - Get user's purchase history
- `POST /api/license/activate` - Activate license key on device
- `POST /api/license/deactivate` - Deactivate license key from device
- `GET /api/license/status` - Check license key validity

**Ready to update the implementation plan for one-time payment model!** 🚀
